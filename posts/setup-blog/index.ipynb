Thes blogposts will be a mix of things... sideprojects, paper reviews etc. I think this will involve using the ipynbs and a framework that converts these to a blog, hosted on a github pages site. I want this to be easy to set up and maintain. Can you walk me through the best way to go about this?\n",

    "Great project! Converting Jupyter notebooks to a blog is a well-trodden path. Let me walk you through the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular and well-maintained option is **fastpages** or its successor **Quarto**. I'd recommend **Quarto** since it's actively maintained, has excellent notebook support, and works seamlessly with GitHub Pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why Quarto is ideal for your use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts `.ipynb` files directly to blog posts\n",
    "- Minimal configuration needed\n",
    "- Built-in support for code, math, citations\n",
    "- Great themes out of the box\n",
    "- Easy GitHub Pages deployment\n",
    "- Active development and community\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this into steps. First, let me confirm a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do you already have notebooks you want to convert, or are you starting fresh?\n",
    "2. Do you have a GitHub account set up?\n",
    "3. Are you comfortable running commands in your terminal, or would you prefer to do most setup through GitHub's web interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I know your starting point, I can guide you through:\n",
    "- Installing Quarto locally (or using GitHub Actions to avoid local setup)\n",
    "- Creating the blog structure\n",
    "- Converting your solveit notebooks to posts\n",
    "- Setting up GitHub Pages\n",
    "- Customizing the look and feel\n",
    "\n",
    "What's your current setup like?"
