    "# LeJEPA Implementation for Text\n",
    "\n",
    "As a follow up to my [previous blog post](https://andrewboney.github.io/andrew_boney_blog/posts/LeJEPA/), I want to implement a LeJEPA architecture adapted for text. The original [LeJEPA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08544) focuses on vision tasks, using a latent prediction approach where the model learns to predict representations of masked image patches from visible context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll adapt these principles to text by implementing a transformer-based encoder that predicts latent representations of masked text spans. The key idea is to use **span masking** - masking contiguous chunks of text rather than random tokens - which encourages the model to learn higher-level semantic representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll implement a LeJEPA-style architecture with:\n",
    "- An **encoder** that processes visible text tokens. \n",
    "- A **predictor** that learns to predict the target encoder's representations of masked spans\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to train this model from scratch on a text dataset and evaluate how well the learned representations capture semantic information. This is primarily an implementation exercise to better understand how the LeJEPA architecture works and how it can be adapted beyond vision tasks."

    "Thanks. Now, how can we build the encoder model. I want a transformer based text encoder that can get representations of the source and targets, with masking based on the source/target split. We'll also need a predictor that predicts the target from the context?\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially was under the impression that the target encoder would be a copy of the source encoder that is updated as a moving average. However it appears from re-reading the LeJEPA paper that SIGReg supposedly removes the need for EMA. I can also see that other and other JEPA implementations, [e.g. this repo](https://github.com/jerber/lang-jepa/blob/main/src/encoder/train.py), aren't using stop gradients. I'm going to go ahead using the same encoder for source and target, however I will check for collapse (i.e. encoder producing constant vectors), as this is known to be an issue with JEPA architectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because I'm working in an environment with limited compute, I think it would be better for the predictor just to be a linear layer, rather than a transformer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets do this bit by bit, starting with creating an encoder and showing how we can get source and target representations in a batched way. I think the challenge here is that batches of sources and targets will be inconsistent lengths. If possible I think we should deal with this through passing the mask when we get representations.  \n",

Most of the prompts above have come from multiple revisions, and my own rewrites after double checking other implementations and the LeJEPA paper. I suppose because it's a relatively new technique that it isn't widely seen in the training data. \r\n",

I've relied quite a lot on [this repo](https://github.com/jerber/lang-jepa), and it could be interesting to try and add LeJEPA in here, while potentially also adding evaluation so that we can compare LeJEPA to the repos original implementation, and with other text encoders.
