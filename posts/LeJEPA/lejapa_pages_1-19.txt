Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding
Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to
ad-hoc R&D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it inLeJEPA, a lean, scalable, and
theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution

objective–Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization(SIGReg)–to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal
distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and
practical benefits: (i) single trade -off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across
hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop -gradient,

only≈50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and
domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA
reaches 79% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will
reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (GitHub repo).

1 Introduction
Learning manipulable representations of the world and
its dynamics is a long -standing question in AI, with roots
datingbackcenturiesago[VonHelmholtz,1867,Tolman,
1948, Gregory, 1980, Sutton, 1991, Friston, 2010]. Across
domains, e.g.,image recognition, robotics,physics, space
exploration,theunifyingquestionishowtolearnanorga-
nized and actionable high -dimensional embedding space from
observations?UsingDeepNetworks–parameterizednon-
linear operators 𝑓𝜽–to map observations to embeddings
isastandardfirstpieceofthatpuzzle[LeCunetal.,2015,
Goodfellow et al., 2016]. The second, less standardized,
piece of that puzzle ishow to train 𝑓𝜽. Joint-Embedding
Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) suggest training 𝑓𝜽by
maximizing predictive agreement between the embed-
dings of semantically relatedviews[Bromley et al., 1993,
LeCun, 2022, Balestriero et al., 2023]. Views can come
in two forms: transformations or corruptions. They can
involvemasking,cropping,blurring,temporalorspatial
translations, geometric or photometric transformations,
viewpoint changes, views from different sensor modali-
ties,etc. Thesupervisedformsinvolvehuman-produced
components suchas image-captionpairs, text-code pairs,
etc [Tian et al., 2020]. In any case, views are expected
to share some degree of semantic relationship to allow
thepredictiontasktoalign 𝑓𝜽’sembeddingstowardsthe
underlying knowledge present in the data.
Alas, JEPA’s prediction task admits failure modes, such
as representation collapse, where 𝑓𝜽maps all inputs to
nearly identical embeddings (complete collapse) or to a low-
dimensional subspace (dimensional collapse) [Jing et al.,
2021][Jing et al., 2021, Cosentino et al., 2022, Balestriero
and LeCun, 2022]. To mitigate such shortcut solutions,
state-of-the-art recipes rely on heuristics–stop -gradient
[Chen et al., 2020a], asymmetric view generation [Wang
etal.,2022],teacher–studentnetworkswithcarefullytuned
EMA schedules [Caron et al., 2021, Tian et al., 2021], ex-
plicit normalizationand whitening layers [Ermolovet al.,
2021, Chen et al., 2021]–and a delicate balance of hyperpa-
rameters. Asaresult,today’sJEPAtrainingisbrittleand
most research has shifted toward scaling data [Vo et al.,
2024], models [Fan et al., 2025] and even post-training Ro-
das et al. [2025] while leaving the theoretical foundations
of JEPAs largely unexplored.
Our study proposes to break that cycle by question-
ing some of the fundamental design principles under-
pinning JEPAs. That introspection will start by asking
what are the necessary conditions that JEPAs should abide
by?Those minimal conditions will then act asaxioms
for us to design a novel and lean JEPA. We identify two
axioms: (i) solving the prediction task while (ii) enforc-
ingan isotropicGaussiandistribution ofthe embeddings(Section3). While(i)followsstandardpractice[Balestriero
and LeCun, 2022], we introduce in Section 4 a novel dis-
tribution matching objective–Sketched Isotropic Gaussian
Regularization(SIGReg)–toenforce(ii). TheuseofSIGReg
not only removes the need for the numerous heuristics
previouslyemployedtopreventrepresentationcollapse,
butSIGRegalsoexhibitsfavorablescalingpropertiesasits
memoryandcomputationalcomplexityislinearindimension
and sample size. Crucially, SIGReg’s isotropic Gaussian
enforcement solves the collapsed shortcut solution and
provably minimizes the model’s expected risk over the
spaceofdownstreamtaskstobeencounteredpost-training.
TheresultingJEPAsolution–coinedLatent-EuclideanJEPA
(LeJEPA)–is introduced in Section 5. Beyond theoretical
optimality, LeJEPA offers numerous benefits such as (i)
provable statistical guarantees, (ii) removal of heuristics
such as teacher-student networks, (iii) linear memory and
computational complexity, and most importantly (iv) a
unifieddesignwithasingletrade-offparameterthatworks
outoftheboxacrossdatasets,architecturesandscales(see
Section 6). We summarize our contributions below.
Contribution 1: We prove the optimal embedding
distribution for foundation models.We establish that
theisotropicGaussianuniquelyminimizesdownstream
prediction risk across broad task families. In Section 3, we
derive this result rigorously for both linear (Section 3.1)
and nonlinear probes (Section 3.2), providing the first
principledanswertowhatdistribution 𝑓𝜽’sembeddings
should follow. This theoretical result transforms JEPA
designfromheuristicexplorationtotargetedoptimization.
Contribution 2: We introduce SIGReg, a distribution
matching objective that uniquely combines provable
correctness with computational efficiency at scale.We
presentSketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization(SIGReg),
a novel objective that enforces distributional alignment
via random projections and characteristic-function match-
ing (Section 4 and Figure 2). SIGReg provides statistical
guarantees (Sections 4.1 and 4.2) while achieving linear
complexityandboundedgradients—acombinationthat
existing distribution matching methods do not offer. Criti-
cally, its projection-based construction defeats the curse
of dimensionality (Section 4.3), making it both theoreti-
callysound and practically efficientfor high-dimensional
embeddings.
Contribution3: WedesignLeJEPA,astatisticallyop-
timalJEPA that eliminatescollapse byconstruction.By
combining JEPA’s predictive objective with SIGReg target-
ing the isotropic Gaussian, weintroduceLeJEPA—Latent-

hyperparameter,eliminatesrepresentationalcollapsewith-
out stop-gradients or teacher-student architectures, and

perparametertuning. Thisdemonstratesthatprincipled

of views, and 𝐷is the dimension. One entry of this
dataset is accessed via 𝒙𝑛,𝑣,𝑑. Those dimensions are often
interpreted as follows: (N) is the number of independent
samples, e.g., different images or different videos, (V) is
the number ofviews, e.g., data-augmentations for images,
frames for videos, and (D) is the dimension of each 𝒙𝑛,𝑣,
e.g., number of RGB pixels for images. In many cases
the ordering over 𝑉is given bytime–but in some cases,
e.g., data-augmentation of an image, ordering becomesirrelevant. Our study does not require any particular
choice to organize one’s dataset into a (𝑁,𝑉,𝐷) tensor–

is not degenerate.(1)
JEPAs varies greatly between use-cases, they all rely on
two core principles: (i) being able to predict the embed-
dingofaview 𝒙𝑛,𝑣fromtheembeddingofanotherview
𝒙𝑛,𝑣′,𝑣′≠𝑣, all while (ii) ensuring that the embeddings
do not become degenerate. Concretely, once a JEPA is
designed and trained, it should be able to solve numer-
ous downstream tasks in zero or few shots. The JEPA
objective function, along with some examples for 𝒙, is
providedinEquation(1). Thepredictabilitycriterioncanbe
done by directly comparing the embeddings of the partial
views𝐸𝑛𝑐(𝒙𝑛,𝑣,.)and𝐸𝑛𝑐(𝒙𝑛,𝑣′,.)with a metric, e.g., ℓ𝑝. In
some cases, an additional DN coinedPred, is employed
to compare 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑(𝐸𝑛𝑐(𝒙 𝑛,𝑣,.))against𝐸𝑛𝑐(𝒙𝑛,𝑣′,.)–which is
only justified when there exists an asymmetry between
the information content of the different views, e.g., by
conditioning the predictions on observed actions from
robotics data [Khazatsky et al., 2024].
2.2 The Need for Reliable Pretraining
The JEPA’s prediction task is designed based on a priori
knowledge of the data. Its design is often quite natural
since it is relatively intuitive to form 𝒙so that its views
sharetherelevantinformationcontentonehopetocapture.
On the other hand, the design of the “anti-collapse” crite-
rion is much closer to a game of Whac-A-Mole. Today’s
designsrelyonmanydifferentunder-specifiedsafeguards
which are carefully combined in the hope that degener-
ateshortcutsolutionsareavoidedduringtraining. Such
mechanisms include (i) feature whitening [Ermolov et al.,
2021, Bardes et al., 2021], (ii) negative samples [Chen
et al., 2020a, He et al., 2020], and (iii) asymmetric views
andteacher-studentnetworkswithstop-gradient[Caron
et al., 2021, Assran et al., 2023]. Those mechanisms all
suffer from at least two of the following limitations: (i)under-specification, i.e., the criteria can be minimized
while embeddings are in a degenerate configuration, (ii)
quadratictimeandmemorycomplexitywithmini-batch
size and/or embedding dimension, (iii) sensitivity to data
distribution,hyperparameters,architecture,and(iv)lack
of theoretical understanding and guarantees.
2.3 The Need for Actionable Theory
For decades, the two major solutions for AI were super-
visedlearning[LeCunetal.,2015]andlearningbyrecon-
struction [Rumelhart et al., 1986]–sometimes combined
together, e.g., for semi-supervised learning [Kingma et al.,
2014]. Insupervisedlearning,thelabelsbothensurethat

beddingspacewhilepreventingcompleterepresentation

embeddings, i.e., the embeddings must be as informative
abouttheinputaspossible–uptosomeoptionaldenoising
tasks that users can setup as part of the training [Vincent
et al., 2010].
Because supervised and reconstruction-based learning
have been widely studied for decades, there exists a large
bodyofworktoexplainandinformpracticaldesigns–as

models [Balestriero and LeCun, 2024, Van Assel et al.,
2025]. This is not the case for the more recent JEPAs
where empirical advances quickly outpace anyone hoping
todelveintotheirinnerworkings. Thisdynamicledthe
community to focus on post-hoc theoretical justification
of already found solutions [Liu et al., 2021, Shwartz Ziv

interpreting alreadydeveloped JEPAs, toolittle principled

stead, most of the recent empirical advances take the form

3 Latent Euclidean: Embeddings
Should be Isotropic Gaussian
We address a fundamental question:which distribution
should Enc(𝒙)followtominimizeempiricalriskonanydown-
stream task?We prove that the isotropic Gaussian is the
unique optimal distribution for both linear (Section 3.1)
and nonlinear probing (Section 3.2), with geometric in-
tuition provided in Section 3.3. This theoretical result
establishes the necessary design principle for our JEPA;
Section 4 then provides the practical implementation to
achieve it.
3.1 Linear Probing
Webeginbyidentifyingtheoptimaldistributionfor 𝑓𝜽’s
embeddingsbyanalyzinglinearprobes–oneofthemost
popular methods for frozen encoder evaluation. Specif-
ically, we ask:which distribution for 𝑓𝜽(𝒙)would be most
favorable for solving arbitrary downstream tasks, i.e., for any
realization of targets𝒚?
Denote as 𝒁∈R𝑁×𝐾the matrix of 𝑁embeddings, each
𝐾-dimensional, from 𝑓𝜽(𝒙𝑛). Theunknowncorresponding
labelsaredenotedas 𝒚∈R𝑁. Withoutlossofgenerality,we
consider univariate targets; the following analysis extends
to multivariate targets. The linear probe minimizes the
following least square problem [Bishop and Nasrabadi,
2006]
ˆ𝛽=arg min
𝛽∈R𝐾∥𝒚−𝒁𝛽∥2
2+𝜆∥𝛽∥2
2,(OLS)
whereˆ𝛽is the optimal probe parameters, and 𝜆≥0
is an hyperparameter controlling the Tikhonov regular-
izer strength [Bishop, 1995, Golub et al., 1999]. Despitenot knowing 𝒚, it is possible to describe the bias and
variance of the estimator ˆ𝛽as a function of the distri-
bution of 𝒁. Consider two embeddings with identical
columnspans 𝒁aniso,𝒁iso.𝒁aniso’scovariancematrixeigen-
values are given by {𝜆𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1with at least two distinct
values,while 𝒁iso’scovariancematrixeigenvaluesareall
equalto1
𝐾Í𝐾
𝑘=1𝜆𝑘. Hence,thetwocandidateembeddings
𝒁aniso,𝒁isocapture the same intrinsic features and have
same energy, but different geometries.
Lemma 1: Anisotropy amplifies bias
Whenever 𝜆𝐾> 𝜆 1, there always exists a downstream task
(𝒚) for which 𝒁anisoproduces a higher bias estimator than
𝒁isofor𝜆 >0. (Proof in Section B.1.)
Lemma 2: Anisotropy amplifies variance
With𝜆=0,thetotalvarianceof ˆ𝛽(OLS)isminimizedfor 𝒁iso
with tr(Var(ˆ𝜷aniso))>tr(Var(ˆ𝜷iso)). (Proof in Section B.2.)
From the above lemmas. 1 and 2 we obtain that the
distributionoffeaturesmustbeisotropic. Wenowmove
to nonlinear probing where the standard Gaussian will
emerge as the unique optimum.
3.2 Nonlinear Probing
To allow for more flexible evaluation of the pretrained
encoder𝑓𝜽,ithasbecomeincreasinglycommontowork
with a nonlinear probe. We analyze two widely-used
nonlinearmethods: radius-basedk-NN[Taunketal.,2019,
SunandHuang,2010,Zhangetal.,2017,AbuAlfeilatetal.,
2019] for its simplicity and kernel methods [Nadaraya,
1964, Watson, 1964] for their theoretical tractability.
AsinSection3.1,weaskourselveswhichdistributionof

We first define our prediction function. The training data

where𝒩𝑟0(𝒒)={𝑛:∥𝒛 𝑛−𝒒∥≤𝑟 0}. The specific choice

and among distributions with a scalar-based covariance con-
straint, the isotropic Gaussian is the unique minimizer of the
integrated square bias. (Proof in Sections B.4 and B.7.)
Numerous additional details and discussions on the
regularity assumptions we employed are provided in Sec-
tion A. Together, these results establish the isotropic Gaus-
sian distribution as the optimal design to minimize the
worst-case risk of a foundation model across downstream
tasks.
3.3 Geometric and Practical Insights
We now empirically validate that the isotropic Gaussian is
optimal when no information about downstream tasks is
available. We focus on linear probing (Section 3.1), where
all considered distributions have the same total variance.
Whenemployingalinearprobe,ananisotropicdistri-
bution increases both bias (with Tikhonov regularization)
and variance. Examining bias first (lemma. 1), we present
in Figure 18 visualizations for both continuous regres-
sion and discrete classification tasks. We observe that
the cosine similarity between estimated and ground-truthparameters equals 1 only for isotropic distributions, de-

Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization(SIGReg)–a dis-

cient even with as few knots as 17, as ablated in Figure 20.
Inparticular,weleveragethesymmetryoftheintegrand

On the other hand, the use of minibatches introduces a
bias vanishing at rate𝒪(1/𝑁), as formalized below.

therefore both the loss and its derivative have a bias of order
𝑂(1/𝑛). (Proof in Section B.13.)
Hence,thegradientsweobtainfromusing (Epps–Pulley)
are biased by an explicit 𝒪(1/𝑁)term. We found this bias
to be minimal and not a concern even for minibatches
as small as 16. Unbiased alternatives include using U-
statistic debiasing of |𝜙𝜃|2or sample splitting, which we
do notexplore inthis study. Ourfinal implementationof

Altogether,theentireimplementation–besidestheusual

a few dozens lines in PyTorch (algorithms 1 and 2). The
absenceofprototypes,stop-gradients,andteacher-student

one hyperparameter, 𝜆, balancing the trade-off between
the prediction and isotropic Gaussian terms.

Prior to presenting our experiments (Section 6), we con-

While there is no existing solution employing such
slicing and distribution matching for JEPAs, there exists
similar pipelines for generative models and optimal trans-
port. Notably,theSlicedScoreMatching[Songetal.,2020]
proposes to leverage univariate slicing of the space to ease
the estimation of a density for generative models. In a

Hyper-Parameters and Architectures
WenowdemonstrateLeJEPA’sstabilityacrosshyperparam-
eters, architectures, and experimental setups. Additional
cross-domain stability results are presented in Section 6.3.

1K.OnImageNet-100,wetrainaResNet-50andvarythe
number of views and the loss weighting 𝜆(Figure 8).
Performance remains stable across both dimensions, lead-
ing us to recommend 𝜆=0.05 as a robust default. On
ImageNet-1K, we train a ViT-Large/14 and explore batch
size, as well as the number of global ( 𝑉g) and local ( 𝑉l)
views(Table1b). Wefindthattheconfigurationcommonly
usedinpriorwork( 𝑉g=2,𝑉 l=8)transferswelltoLeJEPA.
Notably,LeJEPAachievescompetitiveperformancewith
batch sizes as small as 128 on ImageNet-1K (Table 1c),
suggesting reduced memory requirements compared to
existing methods.We thus recommend to use 𝜆=0.05 ,
𝑉g=2,𝑉 l=8, and batch size≥128as starting points.
StabilityacrossEpps-Pulleyhyperparameters.Wenext
examine hyperparameters specific to LeJEPA: the num-
ber of slices|𝒜|in SIGReg, the integration domain for
the Epps-Pulley test (Epps–Pulley) , and the number of
quadrature points for numerical integration. Table 1a
showsablationsonImageNet-1KwithViT-Large/14. Both

Figure 9.INet10 pretraining and frozen backbone linear evaluation across 50timm models using LeJEPA out of the box. We cross-validate the
learning rate and weight-decay. While thereis a small variation between the best and worst performing model, weclearly see thatacross50models
spanning8families, LeJEPA is able to produce non-trivial representations able to solve the downstream task at SOTA levels.
Stability across architectures.A key advantage of
LeJEPA over recent methods (e.g., ĲEPA, DINOv2) is
its architecture-agnostic design. While most modern self-
supervisedmethodsaretailoredtoVisionTransformers,
LeJEPA works across diverse architecture families with-
out modification. To validate this claim, we pretrain
approximately 50 architectures from 8 different families
onImageNet-10,selectingallmodelsinthetimmlibrary
withfewerthan20Mparameters. Allmodelsareableto
learnhigh-qualityrepresentationsreachingbetween91.5%
to95%top1accuracywithfrozenbackbonelinearprob-
ing. Itseemsthatmodelsperformingwellinsupervised
learning setups are also the ones to favor for LeJEPA, such
as resnets and ViTs.We thus recommend to use standard
architectures such as ResNets and ViTs over specialized models
like EfficientNet as stating point.
Removalofpopularheuristics.Inadditiontoproviding

traditionally used to prevent collapse. First, prior work
has shown both empirically and theoretically that predic-
tors in image JEPA (without asymmetric information) and
teacher-student architectures serve primarily to prevent
collapse [Grill et al., 2020, Jing et al., 2021, Tian et al.,
2021, Caron et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2021]. Removing

work demonstrated that register tokens are needed to pre-

in Table 1 that such instabilities likely stem from poorly

notrequireregistertokensandachievesstableperformance

TodemonstrateLeJEPA’sversatilityandabilitytoresolve
that current pain-point, we propose to pretrain directly
on a new domain without any change in the loss or the
pretraining pipeline. We select the Galaxy10 dataset, a
galaxy morphology classification task that differs signif-
icantlyfromnaturalimagesinbothvisualstructureand
statistical properties [Balestriero et al., 2025]. The dataset
contains 11,000 training samples across 10 galaxy types.
For LeJEPA, we use the default hyper-parameters and pre-
trainfor400epochsavarietyofbackbones. Wecompare
against the latest DINOv2, DINOv3 and ĲEPA. We report
in Figure 12 the top1 accuracy for linear probing both
with frozen backbone and full-finetuning. We observe
thatin-domain pretraining with LeJEPA substantially
outperformsstate-of-the-artfrontiermodels(DINOv2,
DINOv3) on both linear probing and full finetuning.
AdditionaldatasetsandbackbonesareprovidedinTable5

a dataset with 1000samples (flowers102). Coupling this
resultwiththestabilityofLeJEPAacrossarchitecturesand
hyper-parameters should offer a promising alternatives
in domains not yet accounted for by the latest frontier
models.
6.4LeJEPA Scales Across Data and Models
We now propose to apply LeJEPA over a larger pretrain-
ingdataset,i.e.,Imagenet-1k,andoverlargerbackbones
suchasViT/Large(0.3B),ConvNextV2-Huge(0.6B).For
those two models, we reach an online linear probe accu-
racy on inet1k of 77.1% and 78.5% respectively. Beyond
in-distribution performances, we also explore transfer
learning. Forthoseexperiments,ourbaselinesareĲEPA
with a ViT-Huge (0.6B) which is the closest to our setup,
and we also include a recent improved version of ĲEPA
including additional stochastic prediction tasks [Bar et al.,
2023] that is coined ĲEPA + STOP. For LeJEPA, we employ
thesamerecipeasdescribedinSection6.1andreporttrans-
ferlearningperformanceswithfrozenbackboneinTable2.
WeobservethatweconsistentlyoutperformĲEPAwhile

Beyond top1 accuracy, we also echo our findings from

without explicit supervision [Caron et al., 2021]. To as-
sesswhetherLeJEPAlearnssuchstructure,wevisualize
the attention maps of the learned representations. Fol-
lowing DINO [Caron et al., 2021], we apply PCA to the
embeddings and visualize the first principal components,
which reveal clear correspondence to object boundaries
andsalient regions(Figure 14). Furthermore, weexplore
whether these attention patterns can enable unsupervised
video segmentation—a challenging task requiring tempo-
ralconsistencyandobjectunderstanding. Bythresholding
the self-attention maps of the [CLS] token, we obtain
binary masks that track objects across frames without
any segmentation labels during training. As shown in Fig-
ure13,LeJEPA’sattentionnaturallysegmentsforeground
objects from background with remarkable temporal co-
herence, suggesting that the learned representations cap-
turebothspatialsemanticsandtemporalstructure. This
emergentcapabilitydemonstratesthatLeJEPA’sstability-
focused objective does not sacrifice the semantic richness
of learned features.
7 Conclusion
We have established a principled theoretical framework
for JEPA-based self-supervised learning that fundamen-
tally resolves its core pathologies. Our contributions span
theory and practice: we proved that isotropic Gaussian
embeddingsuniquelyminimizeworst-casedownstream
risk,introducedSIGRegasatractableandprovablycorrect
method to enforce this distribution, and demonstrated
that this approach eliminates representational collapse by
design–andnotthroughad-hoccombinationsofteacher-
student networks, stop-gradients, or asymmetric architec-
tures.
WevalidateLeJEPAacrossdomainsandover 60archi-
tectures including gigantic versions with 1.8B parameters.
In spite of its simplicify , LeJEPA matches state-of-the-art
performancewhilerequiringfewerthan50linesofcoreim-
plementation. Critically, our approach provides what SSL
has long needed: a mathematically rigorous foundation
