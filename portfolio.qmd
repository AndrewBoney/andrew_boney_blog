Welcome to my portfolio. I’ll add selected projects and case studies here.

# [Survey Scriping Agent](https://github.com/AndrewBoney/survey_scripting_agent)

A proof of concept “survey scripting agent”, that takes a survey specification (either an Excel/CSV template or a free-text description), converts it into a structured survey template, and then deploys the survey to SurveyMonkey.

# [Rec (probably to be renamed nanorec)](https://github.com/AndrewBoney/rec)

A project designed at providing a **complete, end-to-end recommendation system**, covering data preparation, training, and deployment in a single, coherent and reproducable repository.
